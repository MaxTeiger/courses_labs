# The Convolution Operation
.small90[
Discrete convolution (actually cross-correlation) between two functions
$f$ and $g$:

$$
(f \star g) (x) = \sum\_{b-a = x} f(a) . g(b) = \sum\_{a} f(a) . g(x + a)
$$


2D-convolutions (actually 2D cross-correlation):

$
(f \star g) (x, y) = \sum_n \sum_m f(n, m) . g(x + n, y + m)
$

$f$ is a convolution **kernel** or **filter** applied to the 2-d map
$g$ (our image)
]
---

# The Convolution Operation
.small80[
Here is the computer vision point of view of the convolution operation

$(k \star im) (x, y) = \sum\limits\_{n=0}^2 \sum\limits\_{m=0}^2 k(n, m) . im(x + n, y + m)$
]
--
.small80[
- Kernel $k$ here is of shape $(n,m)$ and image $im$ of shape $(5,5)$</br>
What is actually happening ?

<br/>
.left-column40.small70.small60[
- Upper-left element of the output tensor is formed by applying the kernel to the corresponding upper-left region in the input tensor
- Output is the sum of the entrywise (Hadamart) product between kernel and region of the input

# The Convolution Operation
.small70[
- What we just saw is the convolution operations product between a $2d$ kernel and a $2d$ image<br/>
]
--
.small70[
- In practice an image is usually broken into several $2d$ descriptions: 1 per color. <br/>
  - The traditional RGB image will be represented as a $3d$ tensor of shape $(3,H,W)$ <br/>
  - $3$ in shape stands for the number of pointers to matrices of shape $(H,W)$. Each matrix
    is a matrix of pixel color intensities<br/>
]
--
.small70[
- What does the convolution operation become in the $3d$ case ?
]

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Then again, what is actually happening ?
]
--
.left-column30[<img src="images/convolution.gif" style="width: 300px;margin-top: 2%;margin-left: -10%" />]
.right-column70.small70[
- Outputted elements formed by applying a $3d$ kernel to corresponding $3d$ regions in input
- After performing a set of convolution operations a matrix is formed
- Final output is a $3d$ tensor
  - Sets of operations performed several times with different kernels
  - Different types of characteristics extracted from the image
- Some padding used, we will see about that later

# Motivations for CNNs
.small80[
- Convolution leverages three important ideas that can help improve a machine learning system: 
  - **Sparse interactions**
  - **Parameter sharing**
  - **Equivariant representations**
]
--
.small80[
Sparse interactions (Local connectivity)
- An output neuron depends only on a few local input neurons
- This is accomplished by making the kernel smaller than the input
]
--
.left-column50[<img src="images/sparse_vs_full_connectivity.png" style="width: 280px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 3%" />]
.right-column50.small80[
- $(Top)$ When $s$ is formed by convolution with a kernel of width $3$, only three outputs are affected by $x_3$
- $(Bottom)$ When $s$ is formed by matrix multiplication, connectivity is no longer sparse, so all of the outputs are affected by $x_3$
]
---

# Motivations for CNNs
Parameter sharing
.small80[
- Parameter sharing refers to using the same parameter for more than one function in a model
]
--
.small80[
- In a traditional neural net, each element of a weight matrix is used **exactly once**
]
--
.small80[
- In a conv' net, each kernel parameter is used at every location of the image (except boundary pixels)
]
<br/>
--
.left-column40[<img src="images/parameter_sharing.png" style="width: 350px;margin-top: 4%;margin-left: -15%" />]
.right-column60.small70[
- Black arrows indicate uses a particular parameter in an output
- $(Top)$ The black arrows indicate uses of the **central element of a 3-element kernel** in a convolutional model
  - Parameter involved in **all output neurons $s_i$**
- $(Bottom)$ **Single** black arrow indicates **single** use of the central element of the weight matrix in a fully connected model
  - Model has no parameter sharing, parameter involved in **output neuron $s_3$** only
]

# Motivations for CNNs
.small90[
Equivariance of convolution to translation
- To say a function is equivariant means that if the input changes, the output changes in the same way
]
--
.small90[
- Specifically, a function $f(x)$ is equivariant to a function $g$ if <br/>
  - $f(g(x)) = g(f (x))$<br/>
  - $ f \circ g (x) = g \circ f (x)$
]
--
.small80[
- In our context, saying that convolution is equavariant to translation means that:

.center[
  $Translation \circ Convolution(image) = Convolution \circ Translation(image)$
]
]
---

# Motivations for CNNs

# Multiple convolutions

.center[
          <img src="images/convmap1.png" style="width: 200px;margin-top: -5%" />
]
--
.small70[
- An image is described as a tensor of $3d$ shape $= (height, width, channels)$
- $channels$ refers to the number of colors: can be $3$ if RGB image, $1$ if grey image etc
]
--
.small65[
- Recall what the $3d$ convolution operations look like: $(k \star im) (x, y, z) = \sum\limits\_{n=0}^2 \sum\limits\_{m=0}^2 \sum\limits\_{c=0}^{3-1} k(n,m,c) . im(x + n, y + m, z + c)$
]

.left-column30[<img src="images/red_kernel_feature_map.gif" style="width: 275px;margin-top: 2%;margin-left: -15%" />]
.right-column70.small70[
- Red feature map $=$ result of all convolution operations
- Red feature map built just like in animated example, only red kernel is $3d$ of shape (5,5,3)
- Output feature map represents red kernel trying to extract one type of characteristic out of the image at all locations
- .firebrick[**1**] kernel, .firebrick[**1**] set of conv' operations, .firebrick[**1**] feature map, .firebrick[**1**] type of characteristic extracted, thus feature map output of shape (24,24,.firebrick[**1**]), kernel params tensor of shape (5,5,3,.firebrick[**1**])

# MLP vs Convolutional Network codes
**Fully Connected Network: MLP (Keras functional API)**

```python
input_image = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = Flatten()(input_image)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
mlp = Model(inputs=input_image, outputs=x)
```
--
**Convolutional Network (Keras functional API)**

```python
input_image = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
*x = Conv2D(32, 5, activation='relu')(input_image)
*x = MaxPool2D(2, strides=2)(x)
*x = Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
*x = MaxPool2D(2, strides=2)(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Strides
.small80[
- Strides: increment step size for the convolution operator
  - For stride size $k$ kernel performs convolution operation, skips next $k-1$ pixels and performs another convolution operation and so on
  - There are $vertical$ and $horizontal$ stride sizes which may not be the same

- Strides reduce the size of the ouput map
  - Stride of shape $(2,2)$ ($2$ $vertical$ and $2$ $horizontal$) reduce number of numerical outputted quantities by roughly $2 \times 2$ 
]

]
---

# Padding
[//]: #  (Useful to keep output spatial dimension of feature maps constant across kernels of different shapes)
<br/>
- Padding: artificially fill borders of image
- Useful with strides and large kernels
  - Because of strides kernel might end up virtually partly outside of the image
- Usually: fill with 0s

# Dealing with shapes
Reminders about padding
.left-column50.small70[
- Sometimes convenient to pad input around borders
- Size of padding is a hyperparameter
]
.left-column50.small70[
- Allows us to control the spatial size of the output volumes 
- Most commonly used to preserve shape of the input
]
--
.center[<img src="images/padding_stride_ex_shape.png" style="width: 520px;margin-top: 2%; margin-left: -10%;" />]
--
.small75[
- In example: $1d$ kernel of size $F = 3$, $1d$ input of size $W = 5$, zero-padding around borders $P = 1$
- Left: kernel strided across the input with stride of $S = 1$, giving output of size $\frac{(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3}{1} + 1 = 5$
- Right: The neuron uses stride of $S = 2$, giving output of size $\frac{(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3}{2} + 1 = 3$
- Notice that stride S = 3 could not be used since it wouldn't fit neatly across the volume. In terms of the equation, this can be determined since $(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3 = 4$ is not divisible by $3$
]
---

# Dealing with shapes
.small70[
**What we learn from previous example**
- In left example above on left the input dimension was 5 and the output dimension was also 5
   - Because kernel size $ = 3$ and we used zero-padding of $1$
- Without zero-padding, output size would be $3$ because that is the number of kernels that horizontally fit across image
]
--
.small70[
**Going back to shapes**
- $W^i +2P$ represents virtual width of image with padding
- $(W^i +2P) - F$ represents space left on image after placing kernel over it
  - convolution operation followed by stride produces $1$ scalar on feature map
     - $(W^i +2P) - F$ must be a multiple of stride
     - $W^o = $ nb scalars produced during horizontal striding across image = $\frac{(W^i +2P) - F}{S} + 1$ 
]
--
.small70[
**Constraints on strides**
- This formula means that hyperparameters have mutual constraints
- Ex: input $W=10$, $P=0$, kernel-filter size $F = 3$ then impossible to use stride $S = 2$, since $\frac{(10+0)-3}{2} = 4.5$ i.e. not an integer, indicating that the kernels don’t "fit" neatly across the input
- Setting of the hyperparameters considered invalid

]
---

# Pooling

- Local invariance
- No parameters: max or average of $2 \times 2$ units
- Using pooling we assume that each unit should be invariant to small translations

# Pre-trained models
.small80[
- Training a model to perform a computer vision task can take days if it has to extract a lot of different concepts in images and has to train on millions of images
]
--
.small80[
- Many models trained on ImageNet and their weights are publicly available
]


### Transfer learning

.small80[

]
--
.small80[
- Use pre-trained weights by removing layers involved in providing the answer to the problem (fully connected layers)</br>
&rarr; Stop at the last layer that extracts concepts (conv/pool layers)
- Loaded network is used as a generic feature extractor
]
--
.small80[
- Add your own set of fully connected layers that lead to the answer using the high-level representation of the image
]

- VGG = Visual Geometry Group, an academic group focused on computer vision at Oxford University
- VGG is also the CNN architecture that secured $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ positions in the localisation and classification tasks in ImageNet 2014
- The main contribution of VGG is to show that classification/localisation accuracy can be improved by increasing the depth of CNN inspite of using small bigger receptive fields (kernels)
- Neural networks prior to VGG used kernels ($7\times7$ and $11\times11$) as compared to $3\times3$ in VGG
   - But they were not as deep as VGG
- There are few variants of VGG, the deepest one is with $19$ weight layers

#  Residual Networks: ResNet

.small70[
Why ?
- When network without ResNet skip connections goes deeper and deeper, training may go wrong
   - No longer extracts anything more useful from current feature maps
- Network can neither stabilize current feature maps by learning identity function that is difficult to learn or go back to previous feature map
- Results during training end up becoming worse

- $a^{l+2} = g(z^{l+2} + a^{l})$; $g(x) = reLU(x)$
- $a^{l+2} = g(W^{l+2} \cdot a^{l+1} + b^{l+2} + a^{l})$
  - if $W^{l+2} = 0$ and $b^{l+2} = 0$ then $a^{l+2} = g(a^{l}) = a^{l}$; **$a^{l}$ copied to $a^{l+2}$**
- .firebrick[Means that identity function can easily be learned]
- Somehow guaranteed that performance will either stabilize or improve

# Beyond Image Classification

### Object detection

- We don't know in advance the number of objects in the image
- Object detection relies on *object proposal* and *object classification*

--

**Object proposal:** find regions of interest (RoIs) in the image

**Object classification:** classify the object in these regions

--

<br/>
.firebrick[
**Object Detection = Object proposal + Object classification**
]

.small90[
- One example: **YOLO algorithm**
]

# Beyond Image Classification

### Segmentation

- Output a class map for each pixel (for example: cat vs background)
  - We predict a class for each pixel in image
  - Usually classes are: "pixel belongs to object of interest" or "pixel does **NOT** belong to object of interest (background)"

.small90[
- One example: **Mask-RCNN**

- $B$ **boxes** sets of coordinates ($4$ values to define each box's coordinates)
- $B$ **confidence scores** C ($1$ per box)
- $k$ probabilities, $1$ proba per class. Each proba is the probability of this class being inside the cell conditioned on an object being in cell
